 I'm an Astral Elf, my skin was a pale pink before I spent such a long time floating but now it is a light shade of purple. I've got stark white hair that loosely frames my face, with eyes that are a deep purple color and that have bright specks of what looks like starlight in them. Jagged purple markings run up my arm from the crystal fragments that are embedded in my right palm. I've got a more slender build with what has been described to me as a tense posture by some of my peers.
