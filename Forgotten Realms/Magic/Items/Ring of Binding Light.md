## Legendary Artifact 

### Attunement Required 

Should the wearer of this ring die by unnatural means the ring activates. Capturing the soul of the wearer and starting the process of repairing the body. This effect prevents the body from being reanimated through any means that would render them undead. The ring takes 24 hours to revive the wearer, glowing when it nears it's completion. Should the ring resurrect the wearer it loses its powers for 1 century. If the ring is removed at any time during the process it immediately unattunes and can no longer resurrect its previous wearer. 

Additionally the ring limits the memories of the wearer's death to limit trauma and acts as a conduit so they may interact with the outside world should they wish. 

Inside the band there is an engraving aside from the magical runes running along it's exterior. (For my dearest Bartruund. Forever may you stay safe. Yours forever, Elanore Cross.)
