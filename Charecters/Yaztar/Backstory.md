I can't really remember  anything that came before floating through the astral sea, at least not anymore. Those memories have eroded away as I have floated ever deeper through the sea. I can still sometimes see flashes and blurry glimpses into my past sometimes, as though looking through a frosted glass mosaic. A grand mansion floating in the astral sea... part of a city maybe, blurry faces,  ...me leaving? Is that right? Did I leave? Or was I sent away? I can’t really remember anymore. I used to keep track of the days, months, and years that I had been floating but keeping track of time in the astral plane has always been hard and being alone out in the depths of the sea makes it even harder so eventually my track of that faded.

## The Whispers and Crystal

The only thing to keep me company for this whole time has been the [[Whispers]], well those and the feeling of being close to the weave. The whispering voices ebbing and flowing like a cosmic tide inside of my head. They had always been just out of earshot though. Like someone talking in another room, you can tell they're saying something but you can’t quite tell what. 

Through my time floating I felt a lot of things happen to the weave, strange things ... painful things ... times when the whole weave disappeared and then came back weaker. Then one day the whispers began growing louder, slowly at first and then they became a chorus as I approached a hidden corner of the astral expanse where the fabric of reality shimmered and frayed. The chorus of voices urged me to get closer. As I got closer I saw floating there in the center of the chaos, a crystal about the size of a fist, pulsing with a purple glow.  

As I neared, its surface revealed a pattern of fine cracks. Inexplicably despite these fractures, the crystal held together. Within its depths, impossibly tiny points of light seemed to float, resembling the celestial spectacle of distant stars. The voices urged me on, demanding that I touch the crystal with a promise that it would send me home, that I would no longer have to float through the endless void. So I listened… and I touched it… and then… I was in a dark void for the longest time.

## The Lie

The voices… they lied to me, they told me the crystal would send me back to the city but that’s not where I ended up. I don’t know for sure where I am but I am not in the astral plane anymore and who knows if I could find my way back. I woke up after… well there is no real way to know, not that time has really meant anything to me before. I believe the voices have brought me to the material plane. 

It feels so wrong to be here… reality is too… solid. Yet the voices remain, no longer a loud chorus but a gentle whisper though I can clearly hear it now. 

## The Corruption

I don’t know what the crystal has done to me. A shard of that crystal remains embedded within the palm of my hand, a constant reminder of me touching that damn crystal. It is from this shard that jagged purple marking snake up my arm, glowing and burning when I cast magic.

The voice claims that this is a gift, one it had to mislead me to get me to accept. I fear what the voices' true intentions might be. 

## Life on the Material Plane

Being here feels so… wrong… everything is so solid. My own body feels so awkward and clumsy. Everything has a shocking amount of heft, the air coarse against my skin. This has only served to motivate me to discover what had led me here, what these voices that won’t leave me truly are and what they want.

Despite my mistrust of them, when they warned me of the other creatures on this plane I listened and moved. Searching for shelter for… food to quell the… hunger? I think that's what I felt inside of me, that’s what the whispers told me it was called. So I kept listening to them and I followed them to a settlement where the people wouldn’t see me as a threat… probably. 

The people of the settlement allowed me in, though their eyes held suspicion. It was overwhelming, but I needed to survive. With knowledge of this place, and no understanding of its customs I had to rely on the whisper’s guidance. Day by day, I started piecing together how to exist in this foreign plane. 

Once I started to regain some strength and had pieced together enough about the world to survive, the whispers changed. They began dangling promises of knowledge, of a way back to... home? All I had to do, they claimed, was build a strong enough spell book, and it would help me achieve just that, while also granting me the power to protect myself. Despite my deep mistrust of their words, I knew I needed some form of defense in this strange land. So, for the time being, I listened. Slowly, I learned a couple of basic spells and began assembling a rudimentary spell book. However, with each spell I mastered, the townsfolk's gazes grew increasingly wary. Realizing that I needed to seek knowledge elsewhere, I departed from the settlement. My goal was clear: find a place where I could delve deeper into the mysteries of magic, uncover the true nature of the voices that haunted me, and ultimately, discover a way to silence them forever. For I knew, deep down, that their whispers shouldn’t be trusted.  



From here Yaztar spends around 5 years relearning how to live, speak, and interact with people before going to Waterdeep where he goes to school at [[Blackstaff Academy]]  for 3 years leading up to the adventure which is how he reached level 3

During these three years, Yaztar has started to specialize in the [[Netherese]], which is when he learned the voices had been teaching him magic in [[Netherese#Loross]]. And he became a specialist on Netherese learning to speak the language and write it. 

Yaztar worships [[Mystra]] and wants to protect the [[Weave]] because it is the only thing that he could feel other than starlight and finds it beautiful. 

It is from this extended exposure that he has developed a sense for the [[Weave]] as if it was a extension of himself and from having felt so many spells being cast and so many spell casters affecting the [[Weave]] he is able to almost extrapolate the effects of a spell on the [[Weave]] and make the calculations on how to cast a ripple through the [[Weave]] that would move it towards that state. 

[[Mystra]] on the other hand is worried by Yaztar and keeps an eye on  him which he can feel and causes him great stress and anxiety when casting so he takes great pride in being a very precise caster quick and efficient without causing too much disturbance to the weave. It is in spite of this that the tainted arcane focus that is embedded into his palms that causes harm to the weave, so he seeks to get rid of the crystal and its tainted magic, free his mind from the voices, and get back to the astral plane and study the rift in the fabric of reality.
